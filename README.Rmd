An experimental R package to parallelise some functions from the excellent {sf}
package using also brilliant {furrr} package. Right now it's just parallel 
versions of `st_join` and `st_filter`. They won't always help and will often be 
slower but sometimes it might be useful. This is just messing about right now 
tbh. The code is deliberately copied from {sf} and {furrr} so that it can be used
as basically a drop in replacement.
